# What is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)?

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution.

## 👉 The main idea: Choose the parameter values that make the observed data most likely.

## In simple words:

## We assume data comes from some distribution.

## That distribution has unknown parameters.

## We find the parameter values that maximize the probability of the observed data.

## There could be several distributions like bernoulli distribution, normal distribution etc and ask to find MLE.

# Steps to find MLE:
## Step 1: Write the Likelihood Function
## Step 2: Take Log-Likelihood
## Step 3: Take Derivative
## Step 4: Set Derivative = 0

# This gives the MLE estimate.
